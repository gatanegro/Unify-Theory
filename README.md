Unified Oscillatory Field Theory (UOFT)

Refined Core Fundamentals

The Unified Oscillatory Field Theory (UOFT) proposes a comprehensive framework that unifies spacetime, matter, and forces under the paradigm of a fundamental oscillatory field. This section provides the refined foundation of the theory, encapsulating its core principles and groundbreaking approach to understanding the universe.

    1. The FIELD (All-Caps):
        ◦ The FIELD is the universal, foundational oscillatory mechanism. It is timeless, spaceless, and omnipresent, akin to a continuous "now" and "here." 
        ◦ It is not void but consists of dynamic photon waves driving all reality. 
        
    2. Nodes and fields (lowercase):
        ◦ Nodes: Localized energy density oscillators formed at intersections of oscillatory photon waves. These correspond to particles, atoms, molecules, objects, and celestial bodies in classical models. 
        ◦ fields: Energy gradients between nodes that mediate interactions, serving as the basis of quantum, atomic, and large-scale effects. 
        
    3. Oscillatory Dynamics:
        ◦ Time: A dynamic process tied to the frequency of oscillation, rather than an independent dimension. 
        ◦ Space: An amplitude-based relational property, evolving dynamically through oscillatory distributions. 
        ◦ Forces: Manifestations of energy adjustments and tensions within oscillatory fields, replacing the notion of linear interactions. 
    4. Fractal Scaling:
        ◦ Patterns repeat across quantum, atomic, and cosmic scales, revealing consistent oscillatory principles that unify physical laws.
