Unified Oscillatory Dynamic Field Theory (UODFT)
 Overview
This repository contains research on Unified Oscillatory Dynamic Field Theory (UODFT), a novel framework proposing that the universe emerges from photon oscillations rather than pre-existing space, time, or mass. The approach translates classical, quantum, and cosmic models into a dynamic field theory, redefining fundamental concepts in physics.

Core Concepts
    • Photons as the fundamental unit: The universe is an emerging field of photon waves, where space and time arise from oscillatory properties. 
    • Nodes and Energy Density: Interference of standing waves forms nodes, analogous to mass in classical physics. 
    • Forces as Tension: Forces are modeled as tensions between nodes, rather than independent interactions. 
    • Non-Linear Dynamics: Reality is a dynamic process rather than a static construct, requiring new mathematical models. 
 Mathematical Foundations
    • Archimedean Spiral: Used to describe field behavior. 
    • Fluid Equations: Applied for dynamic energy modeling. 
    • Scaling Patterns: Using sets of 8 from 1 to 9. 
    • Chladni Tuning: Adjusting to standing wave dynamics. 
    • Collatz Conjecture: Mapping iterative functions to field behavior. 
    • Fourier Transforms: Decomposing oscillatory components. 
    • Peano Arithmetic (No Zero): Number system starts at 1. 
 Goals of This Research
    • Adjust classical Newtonian and quantum physics to fit the UODFT model. 
    • Establish equations describing how the universe self-organizes from photon oscillations. 
    • Develop simulations to visualize dynamic emergence.
