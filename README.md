This framework unifies spacetime, matter, and forces under the paradigm of an oscillatory field. It
provides insights into unresolved phenomena and offers testable predictions for gravitational waves,
dark matter, and particle physics. Future research will extend these results to higher-dimensional
simulations and experimental validation.
